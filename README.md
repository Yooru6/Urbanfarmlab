The Mikrokosmos is a greenhouse equipped with measuring equipment and it is located on the Metropolia's Myyrm√§ki campus. It is equipped with an ebb and flow hydroponic system and the growing medium used is leca-gravel. The climate of Mikrokosmos is optimized to be optimal for plant growth. Mikrokosmos's climate related data is collected by sensors and stored in a firebase database and on a google sheet by utilizing Particle Cloud and Google Cloud Platform. Sensor data is stored in a database every 30 minutes.

The Mikrokosmos has also been provided with an open-API with which anyone can access the data. Api calls and source code can also be found in this repository.

In this repository you will find the work steps and source codes related to building a Mikrokosmos.

## Particle - Mikrokosmos
Here you will find the code used for the Mikrokosmos measuring equipment.

The measuring equipment was built with Particle-Photon and uses the sensors listed below:

### Uploading code to Particle

- Go to https://console.particle.io/devices
- Fill out required information and log in
  - You should now see same screen as in picture below
  - If a previously installed Particle photo is connected to the Internet, it should appear on the page and the color of the ball to its left should be blue
- Click "Web Ide" button from the left side of the site
