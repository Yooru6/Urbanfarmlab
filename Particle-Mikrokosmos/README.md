# Particle - Mikrokosmos
Here you will find the code used for the Mikrokosmos measuring equipment.

The measuring equipment was built with Particle-Photon and uses the sensors listed below:

## Getting ready to import code

- Download the Particle app from the app store.
- Start up application
- Make a Particle account and log in
- Connect the power cable to the particle photon
- Go to the Particle application in your phone, press the "+" button in the lower right corner and select "set up a Photon"
- Follow the instructions provided by the application

## Uploading code to Particle

- Go to https://console.particle.io/devices
- Fill out required information and log in
  - You should now see same screen as in picture below
  - If a previously installed Particle photo is connected to the Internet, it should appear on the page and the color of the ball to its left should be blue
- Click "Web Ide" button from the left side of the site

- Click this link https://go.particle.io/shared_apps/5fbb9b63e6f0b000172c51bf
- Check that the correct particle device is selected in the lower right corner
  - If the correct device is not selected, press the yellow "P" icon to the left of the device name and select the device on which you want to install the program
- Press the "Flash" button at the top left to install the program

## Google integration
### Firestore/Firebase
First, we create a database for particle integration. In this project, we use a firebase database because of its features.
 - Go to https://console.cloud.google.com
 - Sign in with your google account
 - If you haven't used the free trial yet, you can activate it if you wish
 - Select "Firestore" from the navigation bar on the left side of the page
 - Click "Create Project" from the right up corner
   - Fill required information

 - Now you have database has been created.
 - Next, we create a collection in the database. 
   - Press "START COLLECTION" and give it the name you want and press "SAVE"

### Pub/Sub
Next, we create a pub / sub topic for collecting sensor data from the particle service
- Click on the "pub / sub" heading in the navigation bar on the left side of the page.
- Click "CREATE TOPIC" and give it a descriptive name and "CREATE TOPIC"
